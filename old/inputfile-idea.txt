# The syntax for wikirevs.py's input file is composed of a list of articles and category 
# pages on Wikipedia, each on a separate line. Article and Category names should be 
# exactly as they appear in the respective URL. For example:
# 
# Upper-atmospheric_lightning  (Article URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper-atmospheric_lightning)
# 2009_earthquakes (Article URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_earthquakes)
# Category:2009_earthquakes (Category URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2009_earthquakes)
# Category:21st-century_earthquakes (Category URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:21st-century_earthquakes)
#
# Note that a name must be prefixed with "Category:" for it to be considered a category
# by the script to avoid confusion. 
#
# -Exclusions
# A name can be prefixed with a '-' character to indicate that this article or category should be 
# excluded from all results. 
#
# How exclusions work
# Given the name of a category and a numeric depth (0, 1, 2, ...), this script will recursively explore 
# that category and its subcategories (if they exist) and collect a list of all articles that are contained
# in each category. 
# 
# With a default depth of 0, only the immediate articles belonging to the given category
# will be retrieved. With a depth of 1, all sub-categories of the main category would each be explored 
# and all of their pages collected into one list with duplicates removed. 
# 
# With more than one category given in this input file, the script will explore each of them to the 
# single depth value specified at the command-line.
